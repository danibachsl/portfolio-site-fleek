            <p>
            I am a Jr. Fullstack Developer passionate about Blockchain and enjoy being up to date with the latest technologies. I would describe myself as a constant learner, ambitious, pro-active and goal-driven person. I started being interested in crypto since the 2017 crypto market local top where I started investigating about this amazing new technology. Then, I realized how powerful Blockchain can be to solve many problems the economy is currently facing and thatâ€™s why I cannot stop learning about it.
